# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results-

I worked on a project to find out the reasons for increasing learner
subscriptions in the udacity platform to improve the level of the site and predict the
preference of new pages in increasing the number of learners on the site, using the
technique of A / B testing and logistic regression to find out the factors affecting the
increase in the number of learners on the site
